## Geocode Earth autocomplete demo

[Demo link](https://geocodeearth.github.io/autocomplete-demo/)

This is a minimal demo of using autocomplete with the [nextzen/leaflet-geocoder](https://github.com/nextzen/leaflet-geocoder) plugin. It handles most of the work for you and should work out of the box with any Leaflet map.

### Utilizing search and autocomplete effectively
The leaflet-geocoder plugin sends requests generated by a keypress to
`/v1/autocomplete`, but on enter, sends a request to `/v1/search`. This ensures
the low-latency, partial input aware autocomplete endpoint is used most of the
time. The `/v1/search` endpoint, which has enhanced logic for complete inputs, is used when necessary.
