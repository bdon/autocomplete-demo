## geocode.earth autocomplete demo

This is a minimal demo of using autocomplete with the [nextzen/leaflet-geocoder](https://github.com/nextzen/leaflet-geocoder) plugin. It handles most of the work for you and should work out of the box with any Leaflet map.

To get your own API key to add autocomplete to your website, visit [geocode.earth](https://geocode.earth).
